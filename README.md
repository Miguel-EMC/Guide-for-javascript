## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a scripting language that runs in the browser and allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It is a high-level, weakly typed, and dynamic language that is easy to learn and use. JavaScript allows developers to add behavior to web pages, validate form data, create animations, and much more.

## Example of Weakly Typed in JavaScript

JavaScript is a weakly typed language, which means that the type of a variable can change at runtime. Here are some examples:

```js
4 + "2";   // result is "42"
4 * "8";   // result is 32
"a" + true;  // result is "atrue"
false - 3; // result is -3
```
